Submission Guidelines (10 minutes)
• We recommend sharing a link to your solution in a GitHub repository. Make
sure the repository and links are publicly accessible.
• If you do not have a GitHub account, you can share using any other
method.
• Here is a recommended structure for your repository:
• Sumo Logic Query: A text file (sumo_logic_query.txt) containing the
Sumo Logic query.
• Lambda Function: Python code (lambda_function/) for the AWS Lambda
function.
• Terraform Configuration: Terraform files (terraform/) used to deploy
infrastructure resources.
• Screen and Audio Recordings: Links to recordings.
• README File: Brief documentation of the tasks.


Part 1: Sumo Logic Query and Alert (10 minutes)
• Implement a Sumo Logic Query:
PacerPro, Inc.
Confidential 3 of 4
• Write a query to identify log entries where the response time of the ‘/api/data’
endpoint exceeds 3 seconds.
• Create an alert that triggers if more than 5 such entries are detected within a 10-
minute window.
• Screen and Audio Recording:
• Record your screen while you implement the query and set up the alert.
• Narrate your thought process as you work.
